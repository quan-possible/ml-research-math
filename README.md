# Mathematics for Machine Learning Research

**Disclaimer**: I am not a Machine Learning Researcher, but I am planning to become one. This list mostly consists of stuff I found on the internet and advices from people I know who are.

To speedrun your path to an ML research career. 
Spoiler Alert: you can't (but you can try).

Necessary:
- Probability theory
- All optimization
- All statistics
- Complexity theory
- Functional analysis

Probably:
- All analysis
- information theory
- Measure theory
- numerical analysis
- Graph theory
- computational geometry
